# Setup Status

## ✅ Completed
- Repository structure created
- Shared libraries (types, utils, auth)
- GitHub workflows
- .gitignore

## ⚠️ Remaining Files to Create

Due to the large number of files, you have two options:

### Option 1: I can continue creating all files
I can recreate all remaining files (infrastructure, services, documentation) - this will take several more file operations.

### Option 2: Copy from workspace
If you can locate the workspace files, you can copy them manually to `C:\Users\ellio\Documents\credovo-platform`

## Next Steps

Once all files are in place:

1. **Add and commit files:**
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\ellio\Documents\credovo-platform
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Credovo platform implementation"
   ```

2. **Add GitHub remote:**
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/credovo-platform.git
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```powershell
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Would you like me to continue creating all the remaining files?
